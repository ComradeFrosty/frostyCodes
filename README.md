What this repo will have?

- Things I build for practice
- Messign stuff on GitHub, I'm learning.
- Solutions for leat code or any other platforms; focus is? Python, CPP, C# and SQL
- Might or Might Not include System Design stuff, need to figure that out how do actually do that?

Anyways, thanks for coming here - this is just a "Me" repo, feel free to go through and maybe add comments - "Constructive Criticism" (If one can do that, idk man need to see how github works too)

Have a great one, May the force be with you.
